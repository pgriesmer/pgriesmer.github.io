				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>As part of my UI/UX course at Brown this fall, I was tasked with using React to develop a webpage that could filter and sort a dozen different items. <a class="inline-link" href="https://aqueous-refuge-89997.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">The page I built</a> could eventually be used as a results page for an online men's shoe store.
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">1 // Components</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>I began by making three components: one for the site header, one for each product that would appear on the results page, and one for the list that would contain these products.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Header component</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-image-container">
				<img class="shoe-product-image" src="shoeproduct.png">
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Product component</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-image-container">
				<img class="shoe-list-image" src="shoelist.png">
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">List component</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">2 // Filters</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>I thought an online shoe store could distinguish itself by indicating when users might wear different shoes. To this end, I added an "Occasion" field to each product and gave users the ability to filter by the same.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-image-container">
				<img class="shoe-full-width-image" src="shoematerialfilter.png">

			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Occasion filter</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p class="black-paragraph">I then added a second filter so that users could filter out only certain materials, search functionality that serves as a dynamic filter, and a "Reset Filters" button to reset both the occasion and material filters to their default state.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-image-container">
				<img class="shoe-full-width-image" src="shoeoccasionfilter.png">

				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Material filter</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Search filter</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">3 // Sorting</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>I also gave users the ability to sort by ascending or descending price. By default, I configured it so that footwear is sorted by ascending price.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-image-container shoe-image-container">
				<img class="shoe-full-width-image" src="shoesort.png">
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Sort by descending price</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">Outcomes</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<div class="project-paragraph-image-container shoe-image-container">
					<a href="https://aqueous-refuge-89997.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">

							Final product
						</a>
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>The filters, search, and sorting outlined above work in conjunction with one another on the <a class="inline-link" href="https://aqueous-refuge-89997.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">final page</a>. 
				<p class="black-paragraph">Users can sort by price descending and then filter down to "Canvas" shoes only and would only be shown canvas footwear in price-descending order.</p>
				<p>As someone whose primary JavaScript background revolves around AngularJS, this project helped me adjust to the paradigm needed to work with React.</p>
				<p>If I had more time, I would add the ability to sort by occasion (i.e., dressiness) as well. I would also change the favicon to something more representative of the site and tweak the amount of whitespace I'm using a bit more until it looks just right.
