			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>As an intern at KAYAK this past summer, I developed new versions of several pages whose links appear in the company's site footer. One suchÂ page was the <a href="https://kayak.com/about">About page</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="old-and-new">
				<div class="old-and-new-content-container">

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>With its outdated appearance, the old version of the About page was doing little to galvanize potential hires to apply for positions with the company.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">1 // Hero</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>After being given a design and assets for the page, I started by building a hero component that now appears atop many of the pages in the footer section of the site. I built this part of the page as a component so that the background image and overlay text could vary from one page to the next.</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">2 // Slider</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>Perhaps the most involved part of the page was a slider that appears in the "statistics" section on smaller screen sizes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-image-container kayak-image-container">
				<img class="project-paragraph-image kayak-image-three" src="smallstats.png">
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Small-screen version of the "statistics" section</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>After initially configuring the slider to be draggable, I rebuilt it so users would have to click an arrow on either side of the slider to make it slide left or right. The idea for the latter design came from Netflix's streaming menu.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-image-container project-video-container-two">
				<video controls class="kayak-image">
					<source src="sliderthreewide.mov">
				</video>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container shoe-caption-container">
				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">Three-card slide</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p class="black-paragraph">Note how, when three cards are in view (as in the video above), the slider moves three cards at a time. However, when only one card is in view (as below), the slider moves only one card at a time.</p>

				<p>This occurs because I configured the slider to calculate the number of whole "cards" in view at any point in time and slide left or right by the same number of cards with each click of the left- or right-facing arrow.</p>

			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">3 // Offices</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>Towards the bottom of the page is a section containing information about each of the company's offices. I coded these "office cards" as components so that developers could simply add or remove an office from a list of configurable properties when a new office was opened or closed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-image-container kayak-image-container">

				<p class="project-paragraph-centered project-paragraph-caption">An "office card"</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p class="black-paragraph">I also built the header for the same section (which only appears on larger screen sizes) to rotate through greetings in the different languages associated with the countries in which KAYAK owned an office. If the company ever adds or removes an office from the configurable list of offices, the greeting associated with that particular office will be automatically added to this rotation.</p>

				<h2 class="project-paragraph-step">Outcomes</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-paragraph-container">
				<p>I presented my work at the end of the summer, by which time I had also developed new versions of the <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.com/privacy">Privacy page</a>, the <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.com/terms-of-use">Terms and Conditions page</a>, the <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.com/company">Company page</a>, the <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.fr/impressum">Impressum page</a> (which only appears on certain KAYAK sites, based on country and language), the <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.com/partners-contact">Partners page</a>, and <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://kayak.com/press-contact">Press page</a> (and copy-edited all the content on the first three aforementioned pages).</p>
				<p>This project taught me a great deal about web components since nearly every section of this page was its own component. I also became versed in working with Velocity templates (KAYAK's alternative to HTML) and StyleJam and LESS (their substitutes for CSS). I also learned what it takes to make webpages SEO-friendly, accessible, and localized.</p>
